This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the Quantum Computing course of the PSL week

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Required Packages

This project requires several Python packages, including Qiskit. You can install all required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

#### **Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
It is a good practice to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 2. Install Jupyter Notebook

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to install Jupyter. You can follow the official installation guide here or use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```


# 3. Running the Notebook

Once everything is installed, open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the .ipynb file and run the cells to simulate the quantum circuit.

# 4. Course Guidelines

A new lecture will be uploaded here each day.

You can access the latest lecture by either:

    Downloading it directly from GitHub
    Cloning the repository

You will need to create a new repository to store your solutions.

By Friday, March 7th, you must submit the link to your repository.
You are free to use any Git remote service of your choice, such as:
